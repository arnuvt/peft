<h3 align="center">
    <p> Tensor Low rank adapters (LoRTA) implementation using HF's PEFT</p>
</h3>

PEFT is integrated with Transformers for easy model training and inference, Diffusers for conveniently managing different adapters, and Accelerate for distributed training and inference for really big models.

> [!TIP]
> Visit the [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/PEFT) organization to read about the PEFT methods implemented in the library and to see notebooks demonstrating how to apply these methods to a variety of downstream tasks. Click the "Watch repos" button on the organization page to be notified of newly implemented methods and notebooks!

I also included experiment scripts from the [VeRA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11454) openreview submission.

## Quickstart

Install PEFT from pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

Try an example:
    
```bash
python instruct/lora_llama2_7b.sh
```
